# Welcome to OOrbisDocs
> ðŸš§ This Project is still in-development ðŸš§

This repository (*will*) contain the **full source code** for a Web-based documentation site designed to provide a **User-Friendly** interface for exploring the **Unofficial Sony PS4 SDK (OpenOrbis) and the SCE Functions**. 

Inspired by the FreeBSD man pages, the site enables developers to quickly and efficiently search for PS4 system-specific **SCE (Sony Computer Entertainment?)** functions and retrieve detailed information about them.

### Purpose  
As i have found it super difficult to use the SCE functions without the clear context to how they precisely behave:
I made the primary goal of this project to create a resource for developers working with the OpenOrbis SDK.

By making function details accessible and easy to navigate.

### Features  
Users of OOrbisDocs can:  
- Search for PS4-specific **SCE functions** by name.  
- View detailed descriptions of each function.  
- Access **C syntax** for functions, including proper highlighting.  
- Explore **parameter names**, descriptions, and guidance on what values to pass.  
- Understand the **return values** of each function.  
- (Planned) Access **usage examples** to illustrate function implementation.
